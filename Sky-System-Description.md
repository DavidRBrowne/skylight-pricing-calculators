# The Sky System

The Sky system is a motorised cellular blind designed specifically for skylights and overhead glazing. Unlike traditional blinds that hang vertically, Sky blinds travel horizontally across your ceiling, providing elegant light control and thermal insulation for roof windows of almost any size.

## How It Works

Each Sky blind sits on a 25mm shelf that runs around the perimeter of your skylight opening. This shelf provides a clean, finished appearance and masks any gaps between the blind and the surrounding ceiling or wall. When you want light, the blind retracts smoothly into a compact headrail. When you need shade or privacy, it glides effortlessly across the opening at the touch of a button.

The blind is powered by a whisper-quiet Somfy motor, operated by remote control or integrated into your smart home system. The hardware is precision-engineered in Germany with a premium textured finish that complements any interior.

## Configurations

**Sky Single**
For openings up to 3 metres wide by 5 metres long. One blind covers the entire opening – the simplest and most popular choice for standard skylights.

**Sky Duo – Inward**
For longer openings up to 3 metres wide by 10 metres long. Two blinds travel from opposite ends and meet in the centre, ideal for elongated roof lights and lanterns.

**Sky Duo – Parallel**
For wider openings up to 6 metres wide by 5 metres long. Two blinds sit side by side, each operating independently. The optional shelf and central bar create a seamless, unified appearance.

**Sky Trio**
For extra-wide openings up to 9 metres wide by 3 metres long. Three blinds run in parallel, perfect for large glass expanses and feature ceilings.

## What to Expect

When retracted, the slim headrail houses the folded cellular fabric. You will notice fine cords running across the opening – these are the drive cords that move the blind and the support cords that keep the fabric travelling straight. The number of cords varies depending on the width of your blind. While visible, they are deliberately understated and quickly become part of the background.

## Fabric Choices

Sky blinds are available in two fabric types: Translucent for soft, filtered light, and Room Darkening for complete darkness – ideal for bedrooms and media rooms. Both fabrics offer excellent thermal properties, helping to keep your space cool in summer and warm in winter.
